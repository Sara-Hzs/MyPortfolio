                <p>Hey there! It's a pleasure to have you here. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to tell you a bit about myself. <br>
                    After compeleting my psychology degree, I decided to switch things up and make my way to Austria where I discovered my passion for creating and optimizing. Naturally, my curiosity led me to the fascinating world of web design. I dove headfirst into this new endeavor and started with a web design course at BFI, which was an absolute blast. As my thirst for knowledge continued to grow, I took part in a Frontend Developer course at CodeFactory just a few months later. <br> I find that there's nothing quite as satisfying as improving my coding skills and tackling tough projects with a squad of equally passionate folks. Something about the creative hustle of building websites and apps really energizes me. From brainstorming the next big thing to testing out different features, to working out the kinks in the code and troubleshooting bugs, I love the sense of accomplishment that comes with bringing a project to life. So yeah, coding and collaborating with others towards a shared objective is totally my jam - and one that I plan on embracing for the long haul! <br>  When I'm not coding,  I love to kick back with my fam and friends and soak up some quality time. there's nothing like connecting with the people who matter most to me. And when I'm feeling a bit more introspective, I like to get behind the lens and capture the world through my camera â€“ photography is definitely one of my greatest loves!</p>
